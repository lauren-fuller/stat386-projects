## Overview

Data Visualization is an important branch of data science. It is one of the main tools used to analyze and study relationships between different variables. This tutorial will guide you in learning how to create basic types of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate charts using matplotlib in python. 


## Why do I need a chart? Why isn't presenting the numerical statistics enough?

When presenting information, especially to those with limited backgrounds in statistics and data analytics, most individuals will have a difficult time interpreting the meaning of the data. You can talk about numbers and percentages all you want but not everyone will understand what youâ€™re saying. 

However, once you show a chart or graph, all your ramblings make sense. It doesn't matter how well you present and explain the statistics. A nice looking chart just is sometimes better able to communicate to an audience what's happening in the data. 


## Obtain Necessary Python Packages Before You Begin
Matplotlib is the pionner data visualization package in Python. In order to create the data plots taught below, we must first import the pyplot package from the matplotlib library by running the following code: 

`from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`<br />`import seaborn as sns`


<br /><br />

## **Boxplot** ----DONE

**Notes:**
* `df.charges` is the column of data in the data frame named `df` that is plotted on the chart. Replace `df.charges` with your desired input. 
* `vert = False` is the option that tells the program to create a horizontal boxplot. If you want a vertical boxplot, replace `False` with `True`.
* The `text = ` option creates text the plot. Note that this argument only takes string arguments. 
* The first two arguments or numbers in the `plt.text` argument represent the horizontal and vertical position of the text input on the plot. For example, if we wrote `plt.text(.50, .50, ...)`, then the text would appear in the exact middle of the plot. 
* You can adjust the font size of the text by changing the value after `fontsize = `. 
* You can edit the title and all of the labels on the plot by editing the text string in the `' '` in `plt.title()` and `plt.ylabel()`.

## **Categorized boxplot** ----DONE

**Notes:**
* Replace `bmi` with the variable you want to see the distribution of.
* Replace `region` with variable you want to group the boxplots by.
* To get vertical boxplots, switch the order of `bmi` and `region`.

<br /><br />

## **Histograms** ------DONE

Create this Histogram with the following code:

**Notes:**
* `df.bmi` is the column of data in the data frame named `df` that is plotted on the chart. Replace `df.bmi` with your desired input. 
* `bins = ` bins the data into however many bins you'd like.
* Note that `text = ` and `text += ` only take string arguments.
* The first two arguments or numbers in the `plt.text` argument represent the horizontal and vertical position of the text input on the plot. For example, if we wrote `plt.text(.50, .50, ...)`, then the text would appear in the exact middle of the plot.
* You can adjust the font size of the text displayed on the plot by changing the value after `fontsize = `.  
* The `plt.axvline()` command adds a vertical line to the plot. This example plots a line on the mean of the data. You can adjust the aesthetics of the line by editing the strings after `color = `, `linestyle = `, and the integer after `linewidth = `.
* You can edit the title and all of the labels on the plot by editing the text string in the `' '` in `plt.title()` and `plt.ylabel()`.

## **Column Chart** --DONE

Create this Column Chart with the following code:

**Notes:**
* Replace `region` with the variable you want to group the columns by.
* The `hue = ` option allows you to plot mutliple columns of a group. If you just want a single column per group, you can delete the `hue = ` option. 
* `order = ` arranges the specific groups of columns in a particular order
* `palette = ` changes the color scheme of the plot. Click [Here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html) for a link to more color palettes.
* Editing the string in `title = ` allows you to change the title of the plot.
* `viz.set_xticklabels(rotation = 30);` rotates the x tick labels 30 degrees.

<br /><br />

## **Stacked Bar Chart** --DONE

Create this Stacked Bar Chart with the following code:

**Notes:**
* `df.Location` is the data in the dataframe named `df` that is used to separate each bar into its own group. Replace `df.Location` with your desired method of grouping. 
* You can move the position of the legend to the `upper left`, `upper right`, `lower left`, or `lower right`.
* You can edit the title of the plot and all of the labels on the plot by editing the text string in the `' '` quotes. 

<br /><br />

## **Scatterplot with Line of Regression** ---DONE

You will first need to import a new package from the scipy library in order to calculate the line of regression by running the following line of code:

`from scipy import stats`

<br />

**Notes:**
* `TotalSF` and `SalePrice` are the two numerical variables we want to plot the between. Replace `TotalSF` & `SalePrice` with your desired x and y variables. 
* You can edit the title of the plot and all of the labels on the plot by editing the text string in the `' '` quotes. 
*  `stats.linregress` calculates the needed values to create the regression line using `TotalSF` and `SalePrice`. Replace `TotalSF` & `SalePrice` with your desired x and y variables. 
* `num = df.TotalSF.max()` & `nums = range(num)` help properly scale the x axis of the plot. Replace `df.TotalSF` in `df.TotalSF.max()` with your x variable. 
* `plt.plot(nums,m * nums + b,"r--")` plots the line of regression. No need to edit this formula. 
* The `text = ` and `text += ` commands create text on the plot. Note that this argument only takes string arguments.
* The first two arguments or numbers in the `plt.text` argument represent the horizontal and vertical position of the text input on the plot. For example, if we wrote `plt.text(.50, .50, ...)`, then the text would appear in the exact middle of the plot. The positioning has a range from 0 to 1. 
* You can adjust the font size of the text displayed on the plot by changing the value after `fontsize = `.
