## Overview

Data Visualization is an important branch of data science. It is one of the main tools used to analyze and study relationships between different variables. This tutorial will guide you in learning how to create common types of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate charts in python. 

## Why are charts useful? Why can't I just present the stats?

When presenting information, especially to those with limited backgrounds in statistics and data analytics, most individuals will have a difficult time interpreting the meaning of the data. You can talk about numbers and percentages all you want but not everyone will understand what you’re saying. 

However, once you show a chart or graph, all your ramblings make sense. It doesn't matter how well you present and explain the statistics. A nice looking chart just is sometimes better able to communicate to an audience what's happening in the data. 

## Obtain Necessary Python Packages Before You Begin
In order to create the data plots below, we must first install pyplot package from the matplotlib library and import the seaborn package by running the following code: 

`from matplotlib import pyplot`

`import seaborn`

Matplotlib is the pionner data visualization package in Python while seaborn is a little more advanced. I will give examples of creating plots using both packages. 

## Charting Univariate Data
Some common charts used to plot univariate data are boxplots and histograms. 

### - Matplotlib Boxplot

Here's how we create a simple boxplot using pyplot from matplotlib:

The plot will look something like this: 

![Test Image](/Users/lauren_fuller/Desktop/STAT386/Classes/stat386-projects/assets/images/DataVizPost/MatBoxPlot.png)

Commands:
`pyplot.title` is the command that allows you to change the title of the plot and `pyplot.ylabel` allows us to change the label on the y-axis. You just need to edit the text within the quotation marks `''`. The `vert = False` option tells the program to create the graph horizontally. If you want a vertical boxplot, replace `False` with `True`.

### - Seaborn Boxplot

The seaborn boxplot allows for a little bit more customization with aesthetics like color and text positioning than matplotlib offers. We can set up a simple seaborn boxplot plot with the following code:

*image

The plot should end up looking something like this: 

*image

Commands:
The `text = ` option allows us to put a title or any text we'd like within the boundaries of the plot. It allows multiple data types to be passed and displayed on the plot. 

The first two arguments or numbers in the `plt.text` argument represent the position of the text input on the plot. For example, if we wrote `plt.text(.50, .50, ...)` then the text would appear in the exact middle of the plot. You can adjust the font size by changing the value after `fontsize = `. The arguments inside the `outlier_format` command such as `marker = , markerfacecolor = , markersize = , linestyle = ,` and  `markeredgecolor = ` allow us to change the shape, color, and size of the outliers on the boxplot. 


### - Matplotlib Histogram


### - Seaborn Histogram




## Charting Bivariate Data
Bivariate charts can display two types of variables in the following combinations: 
1. numerical / numerical
    * scatterplot with line of regression
    * scatterplot with histogram
2. numerical / categorical
    * bar chart
    * stacked bar chart
    * categorized boxplot
3. categorical / categorical
    * count bar chart
    * cross tab with heat map


- line of regression
    - import scipy import stats 

## 3D Scatterplots
- need to import a new


## Adding details and 
You are free to modify your graph or chart any way you want, as long as it won’t look messy, distracting, and incoherent.
