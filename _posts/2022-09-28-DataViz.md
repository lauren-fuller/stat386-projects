## Overview

Data Visualization is an important branch of data science. It is one of the main tools used to analyze and study relationships between different variables. This tutorial will guide you in learning how to create basic types of univariate and bivariate charts using matplotlib and seaborn in python. 

<br />

## Why do I need a chart? Why isn't presenting the numerical statistics enough?

When presenting information, especially to those with limited backgrounds in statistics and data analytics, most individuals will have a difficult time interpreting the meaning of the data. You can talk about numbers and percentages all you want but not everyone will understand what youâ€™re saying. 

However, once you show a chart or graph, all your ramblings make sense. It doesn't matter how well you present and explain the statistics. A nice looking chart is just sometimes better able to communicate to an audience what's happening in the data. 

<br />

## Obtain Necessary Python Packages Before You Begin

Matplotlib is the pionner data visualization package in Python. In order to create the data plots below, we must first import the pyplot package from the matplotlib library by running the following code: 

`from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`
<br />
Seaborn is another useful data visualization library worth noting. It is more advanced than matplotlib and offers a bit more functionality and aesthetic options. We will load the library by running the following code: 

`import seaborn as sns`

Now that the libraries and packages are loaded,  we are ready to begin making the matplotlib and seaborn charts below. 

<br /><br />

## **Boxplot**

**Notes:**
* `df.charges` is the column of data in a data frame named `df` that is plotted on the chart. Replace `df.charges` with your desired input. 
* `vert = False` is the condition that tells the program to create a horizontal boxplot. If you want a vertical boxplot, replace `False` with `True`.
* `text = ` creates the text string inside the plot. Note that this command only takes string parameters. 
* The first two parameters or numbers in the `plt.text()` function represent the horizontal and vertical position of the text string inside the plot. For example, if we wrote `plt.text(.50, .50, ...)`, the text would appear in the exact middle of the plot. 
* You can adjust the font size of the text by changing the value after `fontsize = `. 
* You can edit the title and all of the labels on the plot by editing the text string in the quotes `' '` in `plt.title()` and `plt.ylabel()`. 

<br /><br />

## **Categorized Boxplot**

Create this Categorized Boxplot using seaborn with the following code:

**Notes:**
* Replace the `df` in `data = df` with your desired data frame. 
* Replace `bmi` in `x = bmi` with the variable you want to see the distribution of.
* Replace `region` in `y = region` with the variable you want to group the boxplots by.
* To get vertical boxplots, put the categorical variable after `x = ` and the numerical variable after `y = `.
* You can edit the title of the boxplot by editing the text string in the quotes `' '` in `.set(title = ' ')`. 

<br /><br />

## **Histogram**

Create this Histogram using pyplot from matplotlib with the following code: 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DfdHTxdt/Screen-Shot-2022-09-27-at-11-13-41-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/23y2dFtw" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

**Notes:**
* `df.bmi` in `plot.hist()`is the column of data in the data frame named `df` that is plotted on the chart. Replace `df.bmi` with your desired input. 
* `bins = ` bins the data into however many bins you'd like.
* `text = ` and `text += ` create the text string inside of the plot. Note that these only take string parameters.
* The first two parameters in the `plt.text()` function represent the horizontal and vertical position of the text string inside the plot. For example, if we wrote `plt.text(.50, .50, ...)`, the text would appear in the exact middle of the plot. 
* You can adjust the font size of the text displayed on the plot by changing the value after `fontsize = `.  
* The `plt.axvline()` function adds a vertical line to the plot. The first parameter is the location of the line. This example plots a line on the mean of the data. You can also adjust the aesthetics of the line by editing the strings after `color = `, `linestyle = `, and the integer after `linewidth = `.
* You can edit the title and all of the labels by editing the text string in the quotes `' '` in `plt.title()` and `plt.ylabel()`. 

<br /><br />

## **Column Chart**

Create this Column Chart using seaborn with the following code:

**Notes:**
* Replace `region` in `x = "region"` with the variable you want to group the columns by.
* The `hue = ` option allows you to plot mutliple columns of a group. If you just want a single column per group, you can delete the `hue = ` option. 
* `order = ` arranges the specific groups of columns in a particular order
* `palette = ` changes the color scheme of the plot. Click [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html) for a link to more color palettes.
* Editing the string in `title = ` allows you to change the title of the plot.
* `viz.set_xticklabels(rotation = 30);` rotates the x tick labels 30 degrees.

<br /><br />

## **Stacked Bar Chart**

Create this Stacked Bar Chart using pyplot from matplotlib with the following code:

**Notes:**
* Replace `df.Location` in `np.arrange(leng(df.Location))` and `plt.xticks(x, df.Location)` with your desired variable for grouping. 
* You can move the position of the legend to the `upper left`, `upper right`, `lower left`, or `lower right` of the plot.
* You can edit the title of the plot and all of the labels by editing the text string in the `' '` quotes. 

<br /><br />

## **Scatterplot with Line of Regression**

You will first need to import a new package from the scipy library in order to calculate the line of regression by running the following line of code:

`from scipy import stats`

Create this Scatterplot using pyplot from matplotlib with the following code:

**Notes:**
* `df.TotalSF` and `df.SalePrice` are the two numerical variables we want to plot the relationship between. Replace `df.TotalSF` & `df.SalePrice` with your desired x and y variables. 
* You can edit the title of the plot and all of the labels by editing the text string in the `' '` quotes. 
*  `stats.linregress()` calculates the needed values to create the regression line using `df.TotalSF` and `df.SalePrice`. Replace `df.TotalSF` & `df.SalePrice` with your desired x and y variables. 
* `num = df.TotalSF.max()` and `nums = range(num)` help properly scale the x axis of the plot. Replace `df.TotalSF` in `df.TotalSF.max()` with your desired x variable. 
* `plt.plot(nums,m * nums + b,"r--")` plots the line of regression. No need to edit this formula. 
* `text = ` and `text += ` create text on the plot. Note that this only takes string parameters.
* The first two parameters in `plt.text()` represent the horizontal and vertical position of the text input on the plot. For example, if we wrote `plt.text(.50, .50, ...)`, then the text would appear in the exact middle of the plot. The positioning has a range from 0 to 1. 
* You can adjust the font size of the text displayed on the plot by changing the value after `fontsize = `.

## So Many More Options
These plots and charts only show the basics of what matplotlib and seaborn can do in effectively conveying data information to an audience. There are many more different types of charts, plots, and graphs you can create with these libraries with even more advanced options for aesthetics and grouping. Although there are many advanced and fancy plotting tools, it is important to remember that a clean looking chart that is easy to interpret is always better than a really fancy looking one that is difficult to read. Practice making plots and charts with the above examples and check out the links below for further clarification on plotting in matplotlib and seaborn. I've also included a link to a google colab notebook below with all of the code from the blog to easily allow you to manipulate and adjust the example plots.
