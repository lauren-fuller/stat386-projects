## Overview
Data Analysis starts with EDA. The Exploratory Data Analysis plays a key role in the data analysis process as this step helps you make sense of your data and often involves visualizing them for better exploration. For visualization, you can pick from a range of options, such as histograms, scatterplots, or heat maps. EDA can also expose unexpected results and outliers in your data. Once you have identified the patterns and derived the necessary insights from your data, you are good to go.
