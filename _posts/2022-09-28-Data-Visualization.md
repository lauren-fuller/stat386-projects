## Overview

Data Visualization is an important branch of data science. It is one of the main tools used to analyze and study relationships between different variables. 

## Why are charts useful? Why can't I just present the stats?

When presenting information, especially to those with limited backgrounds in statistics and data analytics, most individuals will have a difficult time interpreting the meaning of the data. You can talk about numbers and percentages all you want but not everyone will understand what you’re saying. 

However, once you show a chart or graph, all your ramblings make sense. It doesn't matter how well you present and explain the statistics. A nice looking chart just is sometimes better able to communicate to an audience what's happening in the data. 

## Adding details and 
You are free to modify your graph or chart any way you want, as long as it won’t look messy, distracting, and incoherent. 
 

## Python packages
The Matplotlib package is the original pioneer of Python data visualization.
- first need to import the matplot lib 
Seaborn is a more advanced package.

## Line Plot - Univariate
We create a plot using the function plt.plot().
We show the graph using plt.show()

## Adding Plot labels - Univariate
X Axis : plt.xlabel('X axis')
Y Axis : plt.ylabel('Y axis')
Title: plt.title('Title')

- legend: plt.legend()

## Adding Color - Univariate Line Plot
## Markers - Univariate Line Plot


## Univariate Data Visualizations
Histogram
plt.hist()

Boxplot

## Bivariate 
Contains two types of variables: numeric or categorical
Can have the following combinations: 
- numerical / numberical
- numerical / categorical
- categorical / categorical

- line of regression
    - import scipy import stats 

## 3D Scatterplots
- need to import a new
