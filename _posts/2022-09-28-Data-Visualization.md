## Overview

Data Visualization is an important branch of data science. It is one of the main tools used to analyze and study relationships between different variables. This tutorial will guide you in learning how to create common types of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate charts in python. 

## Why are charts useful? Why can't I just present the stats?

When presenting information, especially to those with limited backgrounds in statistics and data analytics, most individuals will have a difficult time interpreting the meaning of the data. You can talk about numbers and percentages all you want but not everyone will understand what you’re saying. 

However, once you show a chart or graph, all your ramblings make sense. It doesn't matter how well you present and explain the statistics. A nice looking chart just is sometimes better able to communicate to an audience what's happening in the data. 

## Step 1
In order to create the data plots below, we must first install either matplotlib or seaborn by running the following code: 

Matplotlib is the pionner data visualization package in Python while seaborn is a little more advanced. 

## Adding details and 
You are free to modify your graph or chart any way you want, as long as it won’t look messy, distracting, and incoherent. 



## Univariate Data
The most common
* Boxplot
* Histogram

It may be worth noting that people are more likely to understand and interpret a histogram than a boxplot. 

### Boxplot



### Histogram




## Bivariate 
Bivariate charts can display two types of variables in the following combinations: 
1. numerical / numerical
    * scatterplot with line of regression
    * scatterplot with histogram
2. numerical / categorical
    * bar chart
    * stacked bar chart
    * categorized boxplot
3. categorical / categorical
    * count bar chart
    * cross tab with heat map
