# Overview
In my last blog post I scraped specific information about the movies so far released in 2022. I'll now be using that data to analyze what characteristics of movies (if any) make a movie successful in terms of gross profit. Here is a [link](https://lauren-fuller.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/20/my-project-1.html) to my previous post to see the step-by-step process of how I gathered the data. Alot of the EDA is done by producing plots and graphs. If you'd like to learn more about how to make these graphs, you can take a look [here](https://lauren-fuller.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/09/22/DataViz.html) at another one of my past blog posts. Here's also a link ********* to the repository containing the data set.


# What am I looking for while conducting EDA?

Having a question to guide your exploratory data analysis is imperative or else you won't know what your looking for. That being said, my question is "What elements of a movie nowadays make some films more successful than others?" We have variables to consider such as the runtime of the movie, the MPAA-Rating, the release time, the company distributing of the film, and the genre. I won't go through every one of these variables in this blog as it would make it lengthy, but I will include a few I find to be interesting. EDA will help us uncover some further questions we may need to ask about what makes a movie successful and why?

# Does the MPAA-Rating of a movie contribute to its success?

We'll first see if the MPAA-Rating of a film has an impact on the success of a film. The idea behind anaylyzing this was to see if a MPAA-Rating would deter a viewer from seeing the film. For example, does a more mature rating get less views? For this variable, we will use ticket sales as a metric as it better measures the amount of viewers than gross profit does.  Let's first create a counting barchart to determine how many films of each rating we have.

This chart tells us that the majority of the films are rated either PG-13 or R. However, which genre has more ticket sales? Let's make another barchart showing tickets sold grouped by MPAA-Rating.

This chart now shows us that although there are more rated R films than PG-13 films, the PG-13 rated films create more ticket sales than the rated R films.

After observing this, we would then take a step further to run some tests of significance comparing the two rating groups to see if there really is a difference in ticket sales between rating groups

# Does the release month of a movie contribute to its success?

The idea behind this question was to ask if there is a prime time to release a movie that would contribute to more tickets sold. Therefore, let's first see what time of year the movies are released.

The amount of movies released each month seem to be somewhat equally spread with the most movies coming out in April or September. However, do these same months also have high tickets sales? Let's see...

September and April aren't proving to contribute to the majority of the ticket sales. It seems like most tickets are sold in the summer time during May, June, and July. It's also worth noting that December has a solid amount of sales as well. We probably need to ask further questions to figure out why this is. It would be good to consider that this might occur because May, June, and July is when school isn't in session and therefore, more families could be attending the theatres at that time. We could also consider that most people have time off from work and school for the Christmas holiday, allowing them more time to see films in theatres. There could be more explanations as to why this is, but we could maybe infer that movies released in the summer time and Christmas tend to have better ticket sales. Of course, a test of significance comparing the months to see if there really is a difference in ticket sales between them would be necessary to confirm that inference. 

# Does the running time of a movie contribute to its success?

I've definitely have gotten tired of watching movies that are well over 2 hours long. Are people less likely to watch them if the runtime increases? Let's make a scatterplot to see if there is some kind of relationship between running time and ticket sales. 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BbfxbqWy/Screen-Shot-2022-11-18-at-10-38-33-PM.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The chart shows no apparent relationship between the two variables. Let's calculate a correlation coeefficient with the following code to see if there is any kind of significant relationship. 
<br />

`df["Running Time (Min)"].corr(df["Tickets Sold"])`
<br />

results:

The correlation doesn't seem to be too strong. Based on the correlation coefficient and scatterplot, it may not be worth further analyzing this relationship. 


# Does the genre of a movie contribute to its success?

Are people more likely to watch a movie based on its genre? Let's first see how many movies of each genre exist in the data set. 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Hkb18z7h/Screen-Shot-2022-11-18-at-10-40-53-PM.png" alt="drawing"/>

We can see from the plot there is an overwhelming amount of Drama films with a solid amount ot Action, Comedy, Thriller, and Documentary films. But which films have the most ticket sales?

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y8KsP2BH/Screen-Shot-2022-11-18-at-10-41-38-PM.png" alt="drawing"/>

The action films seem to do the best when it comes to ticket sales. Reality films also look pretty successful in selling tickets. However, there is only one reality film in the data set, the one film just did incredibly well. It seems that although most of the movies released this year are Drama films, the films that bring in the most ticket sales are Action and Adventure movies. 

# Conclusion

You can probably tell that there is alot more you can analyze with this data and even more you can dive deeper with. You could further compare levels within each factor of the categorical variables and whatnot. But to summarize what we found from the EDA, we see that there is potential for a real effect to exist on ticket sales of movies when comparing different genres, MPAA-Ratings, and release months. The next move would to be make sure the response variable is normally distributed and then perform ANOVA. You can check out the code I used to create all of the plots and other data analysis.
